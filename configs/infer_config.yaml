### Data Pre-processing parameters
## Generate intervals files
interval_size: 50000
wg: False
# Chromosome sizes to be used
# You can also provide a file path that
# contains chromosome names and sizes.
# Look at this file for reference:
# https://github.com/clara-parabricks/AtacWorks/blob/master/data/reference/hg19.chrom.sizes
genome: "hg19"
# Ratio of non-peak to peak intervals in training
# non-peak samples = nonpeak * peak samples
nonpeak: "None"
# If you do not wish to denoise whole genome,
# You can specify a list of chromosomes
# regions: ["chr1","chr2"]
# You can also specify interval ranges for chromosomes
# Equal sized intervals of intervalsize will be generated
# within the mentioned intervals.
#regions: ["chr1:0-10000","chr2:500-20000"]
#You can also provide a path to a file containing
#intervals that are equally spaced with intervalsize
#Look at this file for reference:
#https://github.com/clara-parabricks/AtacWorks/blob/master/tests/expected_results/end-to-end/result.holdout_intervals.bed
regions: "None"

## Input files
noisybw: "None"
cleanbw: "None"
layersbw: "None"
# Batch size to read the bigiwig files, because
# the entire file may not fit in memory if read at once.
# This batch size has nothing to do with denoising pipeline.
# Look at bs: for that option.
batch_size: 1000

# Experiment args
# If both peaks and tracks are False, then the program enters into a default mode and outputs both.
# If both peaks and tracks are True, then the program outputs both.
# If either one of them is True, then only the corresponding denoised output is saved.
peaks: False
tracks: False
# Task is the task that model was trained for. If the task is regression, then model cannot
# output denosied peaks. 
# task: regression
# Similarly, if the task is classification, then model cannot 
# output denoised tracks. 
# task: classification
# The peaks: and tracks: options above are only
#  relevant if task is "both".
task: "both"
bs: 512
# Number of workers to use for multiprocessing
num_workers: 4
# Path to model weights to be used for denoising
