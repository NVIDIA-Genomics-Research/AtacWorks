    "## Tutorial 2: Using a trained AtacWorks model to denoise ATAC-seq data and call peaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we use a pre-trained AtacWorks model to denoise and call peaks from low-coverage aggregate single-cell ATAC-seq data. We use the dsc-ATAC-seq dataset presented in reference (1), section (when text is ready, add a reference to page number, section, table). This dataset consists of single-cell ATAC-seq data from several types of human blood cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected 2400 NK cells from this dataset - this is our ‘clean’, high-coverage dataset. We then randomly sampled 50 of these 2400 NK cells. Here's what the ATAC-seq signal from 50 cells and 2400 cells looks like, for a region on chromosome 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "![subsampled_NK_cells](../docs/tutorials/NK.2400.50.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the 'clean' signal from 2400 cells, the aggregated ATAC-seq profile of these 50 cells is noisy. Because the signal is noisy, peak calls calculated by MACS2 on this data (shown as red bars below the signal tracks) are also inaccurate. The AUPRC of peak calling by MACS2 on the noisy data is only 0.20.\n",
    "\n",
    "As reported in our paper, we trained an AtacWorks model to learn a mapping from 50-cell signal to 2400-cell signals and peak calls. In other words, given a noisy ATAC-seq signal from 50 cells, this model learned what the signal would look like - and where the peaks would be called - if we had sequenced 2400 cells. This model was trained on data from Monocytes and B cells, so it has not encountered data from NK cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to train your own AtacWorks model instead of using the model reported in the paper, refer to [Tutorial 1](tutorial1.ipynb).\n"
