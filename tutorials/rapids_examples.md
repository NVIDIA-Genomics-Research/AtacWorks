# Rapids AtacWorks Examples

We analyze single-cell ATAC-seq data from 5000 PBMC cells and use cuDF to calculate and visualize cluster-specific chromatin accessibility in selected marker regions. Finally, we use a deep learning model trained with AtacWorks, to improve the accuracy of the chromatin accessibility track and call peaks in individual clusters.
